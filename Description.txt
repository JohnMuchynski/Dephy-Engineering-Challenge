Description of Thought Process:
I figured that when the heel strike occurs that the toes of the foot are still in the air but start to descend rapidly towards the floor after the heel phase. 
Thus, by looking at the z values of the gyro it can be determined when the heel has just struck. Although it would have been better to incorporate some of the other sensor data
into the detector, I sadly did not have the time. I believe that just looking at the gyro z values would mean that the gait detector would have trouble on inclined surfaces or 
on people with tight achilles tendons. Also note that there is no exception handling, so  if an invalid filename is entered the program will crash.
